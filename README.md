# Improved-RRT-Connect-for-Mobile-Robots

This repository contains the implementation of **IRRT-Connect**, an improved version of the RRT-Connect path planning algorithm, developed for **ENPM661 - Planning for Autonomous Robots (Project 5)** at the University of Maryland.

The IRRT-Connect algorithm enhances the efficiency of mobile robot path planning in complex environments by introducing additional tree expansion strategies and goal-directed biasing mechanisms.

## Project Overview

Traditional path planning algorithms like RRT and RRT-Connect often suffer from slow convergence and suboptimal paths, especially in cluttered or complex environments. IRRT-Connect addresses these limitations through:

- **Third Node Generation**: A midpoint (or a valid nearby point via dichotomy search) between the start and goal, allowing for the expansion of **four** trees instead of two.
- **Target Biasing**: Increased guidance toward the goal during node expansion, improving convergence.
- **Enhanced Planning Efficiency**: Reduction in iterations, planning time, and path length compared to standard RRT, RRT*, and RRT-Connect.

## Results

| Algorithm     | Avg. Time (s) | Avg. Iterations | Avg. Path Length (units) |
|---------------|-----------|-----------------|------------------|
| RRT           |   0.336     |  1365           |  68.624             |
| RRT*          | 0.458      | 1585.4            |  66.617            |
| RRT-Connect   |  0.180     | 742.85             |  62.672             |
| **IRRT-Connect** | **0.100**  | **585.35**          | **55.241**            |
